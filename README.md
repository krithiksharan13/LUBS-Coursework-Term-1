## 🚀 Project Summary
This repository contains my individual assessed coursework for *Business Analytics and Decision Science*.  
It demonstrates the practical application of **business analytics, predictive modelling, and decision science** to real-world managerial problems, combining technical analysis with clear business interpretation.

The coursework consists of **two equally weighted analytical case studies**:
- **Part 1:** Revenue optimisation using customer behaviour and predictive modelling  
- **Part 2:** Strategic decision-making using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA)

---

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates
- Translating **business requirements into analytical tasks**
- Data cleaning, exploration, and feature analysis
- Building and evaluating **machine-learning models**
- Applying **decision science theory** to strategic choices
- Communicating insights to a **management audience**
